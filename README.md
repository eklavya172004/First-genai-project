# First-genai-project

Sure! Here's a short and clear explanation of what the project is about:

---

### ðŸ’¡ **Project Overview: Bank Customer Churn Prediction with ANN (Artificial Neural Network)**

This project focuses on building an **end-to-end deep learning solution** to predict whether a customer will leave a bank (churn) or not. The prediction is made using a **binary classification model** built with **TensorFlow and Keras**.

---

### ðŸ§  **Key Concepts Covered**
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** using TensorFlow + Keras
- **Data preprocessing** (handling categorical variables, normalization, etc.)
- **Model training** using forward and backward propagation
- **Regularization** techniques like **Dropout** to avoid overfitting
- **Model evaluation** and saving using `.h5` or `.pkl` formats
- **Deployment** using **Streamlit** for a web-based interface

---

### ðŸ“Š **Dataset: `Churn_Modelling.csv`**
- The dataset contains customer information from a bank.
- Features include: `CreditScore`, `Geography`, `Gender`, `Age`, `Tenure`, `Balance`, etc.
- Target variable: `Exited` â†’ whether the customer left the bank (`1`) or not (`0`).

### ðŸš€ **Project Workflow**
1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Perform feature engineering and scaling
3. Build and train the ANN model using Keras
4. Apply Dropout and optimizers to improve performance
5. Save the trained model
6. Create a **Streamlit app** to predict customer churn based on input features
7. **Deploy** the app using **Streamlit Cloud**
